# Clean and Dumb code

![Clean and Dumb Code](https://i0.wp.com/blog.knoldus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/CleanCode.jpg?w=800&ssl=1)

**```"Clean"```** code generally refers to code that is well-organized, easy to understand, and maintainable. 

**```"Dumb"```** code, on the other hand, refers to code that is simple and straightforward, but not necessarily optimized for performance or scalability.

Here are some tips to help you write clean and dumb code quickly:

- Keep your code organized by using clear and consistent indentation, and by breaking your code into small, manageable functions or modules.

- Use clear and meaningful variable and function names to make your code easy to understand.

- Use comments to explain any complex or non-obvious parts of your code.

- Avoid using complex or overly-optimized algorithms in favor of simpler, more straightforward solutions.

- Test your code frequently to catch any bugs early on, and use a version control system to keep track of changes to your code.

- Avoid unnecessary code and use simple solution, if possible use libraries, frameworks and built-in functions to solve the problem.

- Keep in mind the principle of KISS (Keep It Simple and Stupid)

Remember that **```writing clean and dumb code quickly is a balancing act between simplicity and functionality```**. 

By following these tips, you should be able to write code that is easy to understand, maintain, and modify, without sacrificing performance or scalability.
